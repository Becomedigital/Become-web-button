## API Reference

KYC (Know Your Customer) Process

The KYC button integrates the onboarding process for verifying users' identities. When users click on the button, the system initiates the KYC process, requiring the user to upload an identity document or authenticate using other methods.

Button Attributes

| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| userId         | A unique identifier for the user undergoing KYC verification.                                                                                                                                    |
| contractId     | The contract identifier associated with the KYC process.                                                                                                                                         |
| token          | A JWT token created using company credentials, used for secure API requests.                                                                                                                     |
| country        | A 2-character country code (default: "CO" for Colombia). Example: "FR" for France.                                                                                                               |

### Example of docType Usage:

Single Document Type (String):

```html
<become-button
  userId="<YOUR_USER_ID>"
  contractId="<YOUR_CONTRACT_ID>"
  token="<YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>"
  docType="passport"
/>
```

Multiple Document Types (Comma-Separated List):

```html
<become-button
  userId="<YOUR_USER_ID>"
  contractId="<YOUR_CONTRACT_ID>"
  token="<YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>"
  docType="passport,national-id,driving-license"
/>
```

Note: If single document is provided the system will use it as default. If multiple document types are provided as a comma-separated string, the system will accept only the specified document types.

## Events

The KYC button emits events to notify your application about the verification process. Below are the key events you can subscribe to:

| Event Name                 | Description                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| become:verificationStarted | Fired when the KYC verification process begins.                          |
| become:userFinishedSdk     | Fired when the user completes the KYC verification process successfully. |
| become:exitedSdk           | Fired when the user exits the KYC process manually.                      |

### Example Event Listener:

```js
document
  .querySelector("become-button")
  .addEventListener("become:userFinishedSdk", (event) => {
    console.log("User has completed the KYC verification:", event.detail);
  });

// Or using destructuring:

document
  .querySelector("become-button")
  .addEventListener("become:userFinishedSdk", ({ detail }) => {
    console.log("finished payload", detail);
  });
```

### Example Usage:

Hereâ€™s an example of how to integrate the KYC button in your website using Vanilla JavaScript:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Become KYC Integration</title>
    <script src="https://onboarding.svi.becomedigital.net/resources/button.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Become KYC Button -->
    <become-button
      userId="user123"
      contractId="contract456"
      token="your-jwt-token"
      country="US"
      state="NY"
      docType="passport, national-id"
    ></become-button>

    <script>
      // Example event listener for handling events from the Become KYC button
      document
        .querySelector("become-button")
        .addEventListener("become:userFinishedSdk", function(event) {
          console.log("User has completed the KYC process", event.detail);
        });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Summary:
